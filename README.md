# TicTacToe
Simple TicTacToe which makes use of noughts and crosses, displays scoreboard and enables multiplayer.
This is my Andela challenge and my first app. It is not perfect as I am still a beginner and I am still working to improve it so kindly bear with me.
The AI mode is still in construction but the  multiplayer works well. 
The game enables player to choose their board preferences as well as switch between noughts and crosses.
